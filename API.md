# API Documentation

This page shows how to call each request, what to send and what comes back.

## Before you call the API

Start the API in one terminal, and leave it running:

```bash
python -m flask run --port 8000
```

Every URL starts with `http://localhost:8000`. To stop the API, press `Ctrl+C`.

## How to send a request

Open a **second terminal** to send requests. For a `GET` request, you can also just paste the URL into your browser.

**macOS / Linux:**

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/books -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"title": "Dune", "author": "Frank Herbert", "isbn": "9780441013593"}'
```

**Windows (PowerShell):** use `Invoke-RestMethod` instead of `curl`, with the same URL and body:

```powershell
Invoke-RestMethod -Method Post -Uri http://localhost:8000/books -ContentType "application/json" -Body '{"title": "Dune", "author": "Frank Herbert", "isbn": "9780441013593"}'
```

Add `-i` after `curl` to see the status code as well as the response.

## About the examples

- The examples show a fresh database, and they run in the order shown on this page. To get a fresh database, stop the API, delete `library.db` and start the API again.
- If your data has changed, your IDs and values may differ.
- **Dates will differ.** The examples were recorded on 2026-11-05, and the sample loan's dates depend on the day the database was created.
- The fields in a response may appear in a different order. JSON doesn't depend on the order of fields.

## Status codes

| Code | Meaning | Example |
|---|---|---|
| 200 | Success | You got a book. |
| 201 | Created | You added a book. |
| 204 | Success, with nothing to return | You deleted a book. |
| 400 | Your request has missing or invalid data | The ISBN is invalid. |
| 404 | That item doesn't exist | There is no book 999. |
| 409 | The request breaks a library rule | The book is already on loan. |

Every error returns JSON with an `error` message:

```json
{"error": "book not found"}
```

If a request needs a body and you send one that isn't valid JSON, the API treats it as empty and returns 400.

## What the fields mean

| Field | Type | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `available` | true or false | Whether a book can be checked out |
| `type` | text | A member's type: `student` or `staff` |
| `due_date`, `checked_out` | text | A date in the form `YYYY-MM-DD` |
| `returned` | true or false | Whether the book has come back |
| `fine` | number | The fine charged when the book was returned. It stays `0.0` until then. |
| `current_fine` | number | What the loan's fine is right now, including a fine still building up |
| `fine_paid` | true or false | Whether the fine has been paid |
| `renewals` | number | How many times the loan has been renewed |

|---|---|---|
| Check out a book | `Book checked out` | `You checked out <title>` |

| Return a book | `Book returned` | `You returned <title>. Fine: $<amount>` |
| Pay a fine | `Fine paid` | `We received $<amount>` |
