# Campus Library API: Refactoring Activity

This API works and its tests pass, but all the code is in one file. Your job is to reorganize it to **reduce coupling and increase cohesion, without changing what the API does**.

## Set up

Fork this repository, clone your fork and install the requirements. The [before-class setup](before-class-setup.md) has every step, including what to install first and the Windows commands.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/library-api.git
cd library-api
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Check that everything works:

```bash
python -m unittest               # run the tests: 53 should pass
python -m flask run --port 8000  # start the API (Ctrl+C to stop)
```

With the API running, open these in your browser:

- <http://localhost:8000/books>
- <http://localhost:8000/reports/overdue>

To reset the data, stop the API and delete `library.db`. It is recreated the next time the API starts.

## Your task

### 1. Diagnose (10 minutes)

Read `app.py` **without changing it**. List at least five design problems. For each one, note:

- where it is
- whether it is mainly a coupling or a cohesion problem
- what future change it would make harder

### 2. Refactor (30 minutes)

Reorganize the code in small steps, and run the tests after each step. You decide the structure.

Fill in the "Before" column of the table below before you start.

### 3. Change request (10 minutes)

Your instructor will give you a new requirement. Implement it in your refactored code and count the places you had to edit.

## Rules

1. **Do not change `test_api.py`.**
2. **Keep `app.py` in this folder**, and make sure it still provides `app` and `init_db`. It can be very short.
3. **Keep `library.db` and `outbox.txt` as relative paths**, so they are created in the folder the API runs from. `outbox.txt` stands in for a real mail server.
4. **Keep the API's behavior the same:** the same URLs, status codes and JSON.

## Measure your work

| Measure | Before | After |
|---|---|---|
| Tests passing | | |
| Lines in the largest file | | |
| Places where the fine rate appears | | |
| Route handlers containing SQL | | |
| Places edited for the change request | n/a | |
| Can the fine rule be tested without HTTP or a database? | | |

## Questions to answer

1. Which module is the most cohesive? Describe its one job in a sentence.
2. Which dependency did you remove, and what can now change independently because of that?
3. What coupling remains, and why did you accept it?
